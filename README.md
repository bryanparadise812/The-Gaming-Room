# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room project involved designing a full software solution for a client that wanted to scale their game from Android to a cross-platform web environment. Through these projects, I learned how to evaluate operating systems, design distributed systems, and communicate technical solutions clearly. I think I did particularly well at analyzing the strengths of each OS and recommending Linux for its scalability and flexibility.
Working through the design document helped me better understand how to approach development systematically. By documenting architecture and user requirements before coding, I was able to see how the system components would interact. If I could revise one part, I would enhance the security design section by detailing how user sessions and tokens are managed across distributed environments.
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on accessibility and scalability—allowing players on different devices to share sessions in real time. Considering user needs is essential because it ensures the final product is practical, engaging, and accessible. In future projects, I plan to use the same structured approach—starting with requirements gathering, followed by architectural design, and finishing with iterative testing and feedback. This process ensures that both user expectations and technical goals are met efficiently.
